///   app without macOS switching Spaces to find Vervellum a home.
/// * **`canBecomeKey` overridden to true** — a borderless panel refuses key status
///   by default, and a panel that cannot become key cannot receive typing. This one
///   override is the difference between a composer that works and one that silently
///   swallows every keystroke.
/// * **`canBecomeMain` left false** — main status belongs to the app the user was
///   actually working in. Taking it would put Vervellum's (nonexistent) menu bar up
///   and make the previous app's title bar go inactive.
