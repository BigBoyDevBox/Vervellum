/// Per-run logging with a short shared identifier.

/// A research run fans out into a plan call, several searches, a streamed answer and an
/// assessment, all of which can interleave with another run the user started in a second
/// thread. Without a per-run tag the log is unreadable, so every line carries the same
/// eight-character id — the same idea as a request id in a server log.
///
/// What is logged is deliberately narrow: stage names, durations, counts and sizes.
/// Never a prompt, never a search result, never a key, and never a provider's own error
/// text. That keeps the log shareable in a bug report, which is the only reason it
/// exists. The rule lives here rather than in the sink so a new platform cannot weaken
/// it by supplying a chattier backend.
